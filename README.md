Notes:
------
  - Mid, midi, rmi and kar files can be opened, but requires a SoundFont. However, this function is not implemented yet, so you will hear no sound.

YouTube support:
----------------
YouTube support requires ffmpeg.exe, ffprobe.exe (LGPL 2.1, https://ffmpeg.org/) and youtube-dl.exe (The Unlicense, https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/). These are not the part of the package. At the first YouTube download the user will be prompted about downloading and installing these dependencies. The installation is automatic if the user agreed and may require administrative privileges.
